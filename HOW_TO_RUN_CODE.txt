The program requires 2 arguments (one from each category and in that order on the command line):

There are these options:: [-convex -closest] and [-divide -brute]
    - Convex = Convex Hull
    - Closest = Closest Pair
    - Divide = Divide and Conquer
    - Brute = Brute Force

Ex (command line of course):
g++ *.cpp  -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_mixer && a.exe -convex -divide
