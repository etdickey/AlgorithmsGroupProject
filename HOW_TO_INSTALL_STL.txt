download mingw sdl2 (http://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)

From the i686-w64-mingw32 folder to C:/MinGW:
	- from the bin folder, copy SDL2.dll to C:/MinGW/bin
	- from the includes folder, copy the folder SDL2 to the folder MinGW/include
	- from the lib folder, copy the contents into the folder MinGW/lib


for the mixers: (also in the sdl header, comment out all the sound stuff everywhere)
From the flash drive, copy the contents of the bin folder and skip everything that is already there.
Do the same with the lib folder

g++ -o a.exe driver.cpp -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_mixer

UPDATED::
g++ *.cpp  -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_mixer && a.exe -convex -divide
